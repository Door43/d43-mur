The **Persian Empire** was strong but **merciful** to the people it conquered. Shortly after **Cyrus** became king of the Persians, he gave an order that any **Jew** who wanted to **return to Judah** could leave Persia and go back to Judah. He even gave them money to rebuild the **Temple**! So, after seventy years in **exile**, a small group of Jews **returned** to the city of **Jerusalem** in Judah.
